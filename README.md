# EV Infrastructure vs. Charging Station Analysis – Washington State

This project explores the relationship between electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the availability of public EV charging stations across Washington State using Tableau dashboards and data visualizations.

---

## 📊 Business Context

- EV charging stations are a critical factor in accelerating electric vehicle adoption.
- Infrastructure investments offer first-mover advantages and market leadership.
- Better infrastructure supports customer loyalty and long-term planning.

---

## 🧪 Hypotheses

1. Zip codes with more EV charging stations tend to have more EV registrations.
2. EV growth is outpacing the growth of EV charging infrastructure.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Some regions (especially Seattle metro) have high infrastructure density, while others lag despite EV adoption.
- The ratio of EVs to chargers is uneven, revealing critical infrastructure gaps.

---

## 💼 Business Recommendations

1. Prioritize charger deployment in high-EV zip codes with low station density.
2. Collaborate with retailers, workplaces, and government to close infrastructure gaps.
3. Continue monitoring infrastructure vs. adoption trends over time.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Include charging speed/type in future datasets.
- Expand scope to other states.
- Analyze time-of-day usage patterns and peak demand.
