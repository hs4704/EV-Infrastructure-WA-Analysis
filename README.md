# EV Infrastructure vs. Charging Station Analysis – Washington State

An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing the relationship between electric vehicle (EV) adoption and public EV charging station availability across Washington State.

---
## 🧠 Project Summary

As electric vehicles become more mainstream, infrastructure planning is key to enabling adoption. This project uses data visualizations to explore whether public charging infrastructure is keeping up with the rise in EV registrations — and where investments are needed most.

---
## 📊 Business Context

- EV charging stations are essential to accelerating adoption and building driver confidence.
- Infrastructure gaps create friction points for EV owners and slow overall growth.
- Strategic placement of chargers enables better resource allocation and long-term ROI for governments and businesses.

---

## 🧪 Hypotheses

1. Zip codes with more public charging stations will have higher EV adoption rates.
2. EV registration growth is outpacing the expansion of charging infrastructure.

## 🔍 Key Insights


- High-density EV regions like Seattle still show charger shortages.
- Suburban and rural gaps highlight underserved EV owners.
- Ratio of EVs to public chargers varies widely by region, creating equity and access issues.

---

## 💼 Business Recommendations

1. Prioritize low-charger, high-EV zip codes for next-phase infrastructure.
2. Partner with retailers, workplaces, and public entities to increase charger access.
3. Use this analysis to build statewide investment roadmaps and support grant proposals.

## 🔮 Future Expansion

- Add charger speed/type (Level 2, DC Fast) as new dimensions.
- Extend dashboard to include national comparisons.
- Layer in temporal usage patterns for demand prediction.
